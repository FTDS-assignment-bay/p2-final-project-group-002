# Final Project Introduction

The group 2 of HCK-013 would like to welcome you to our final project. In this project, our primary objective is to revolutionize the trading landscape by leveraging data-driven insights and predictive analytics. By harnessing the power of deep learning techniques and comprehensive data analysis, we strive to:

- Develop a neural network model to predict stock prices of the top 5 banking companies in Indonesia.
- Extract meaningful insights from the dataset through thorough analysis and visualization, enabling traders to make informed decisions.
- Automate processes and ensure data integrity to facilitate seamless collaboration and efficient workflow among traders, analysts, and data scientists

Our primary objective is to revolutionize the trading landscape by leveraging data-driven insights and predictive analytics to forecast stock prices of the top 5 banking companies in Indonesia. Through the development of accurate and reliable predictive models, our aim is to enhance trading strategies and empower traders with actionable insights to optimize their investment decisions. By analyzing historical patterns and trends in stock prices, we seek to facilitate informed decision-making processes, particularly for beginners entering the stock market. Additionally, our project aims to foster financial literacy by educating users about the principles of stock trading and investment, thereby promoting responsible investing practices. Moreover, by contributing to market efficiency through accurate forecasts and reducing market inefficiencies, we strive to empower stakeholders with the resources and insights they need to navigate the dynamic stock market landscape effectively.

# Project Overview
The SmartStock project is a collaborative endeavor aimed at revolutionizing the trading landscape through the application of data-driven insights and predictive analytics. Focused on forecasting stock prices of the top 5 banking companies in Indonesia, the project brings together a multidisciplinary team of professionals, each contributing their expertise to achieve a common goal. The workflow started by loading the history of stock prices of the top 5 banking companies in Indonesia through yahoo finance library. Then, the data sets were be cleaned and adjusted by the data engineer teaam through a datapipelnes in airflow and the data analyst team will create visualization and draw insights related to the dataset itself to determine the objective and scope of the project. Then, this notebook will consist of the neural network model construction for all different banking companies. After we defined the model architecture and trained the model with MAPE as the measurement, we predict the train and test set using the model and compare it with the actual test data to measure the MAPE for both the train and test sets. And lastly, the model will be deployed via HuggingFace.


In details, SmartStock brings together a team of dedicated individuals, each contributing their expertise to ensure the project's success:

## Data Scientist:
Our Data Scientist harnesses the power of advanced machine learning techniques to develop an artificial neural network model (LSTM). This model predicts stock prices of the top 5 banking companies in Indonesia, offering traders accurate and reliable forecasts to guide their investment decisions.

## Data Analyst:
The Data Analyst plays a pivotal role in extracting meaningful insights from the dataset through thorough analysis and visualization. By interpreting the implications of prediction results from a business perspective, they provide traders with actionable insights to optimize their trading strategies.

## Data Engineer:
The Data Engineer focuses on automating processes and ensuring data integrity. Their expertise in building and maintaining data pipelines guarantees the accuracy and suitability of data utilized by Data Analysts and Data Scientists, facilitating seamless collaboration and efficient workflow.
